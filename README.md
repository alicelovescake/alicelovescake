### Hi there!

I'm a learner who codes. 

A reader who writes. 

An adventurer who never stops wandering. 

From eating rotten shark 🦈 in Iceland to floating in the Dead Sea 🌊 to trekking to the top of Everest 🏔️, I love to challenge myself!

I'm here to build products that creates an inclusive world! 🌎

I'm currently building [12 products in 12 months](https://www.12products.xyz/) to ideate, learn, and do more of what I love ... [code](https://github.com/12products)! 

Check out more on @ [alicezhao.com](alicezhao.com) 🌱
