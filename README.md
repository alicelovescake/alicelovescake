### Hi there!

I'm a learner who codes. 👩‍💻

A reader who writes. ✍🏼

An adventurer who never stops wandering. 🌍

From eating rotten shark in Iceland to floating in the Dead Sea to trekking on Everest, I love to challenge myself! 🏔️

### Now

I'm currently building [12 products in 12 months](https://www.12products.xyz/)!  🎉

I'm also a full-stack software engineer intern at [Rivian](https://rivian.com/), on a mission to keep the world adventurous forever! 🚗
