### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a learner who codes. A reader who writes. An explorer who never stops wandering. From eating rotten shark in Iceland to floating in the Dead Sea to trekking to the top of Everest, I love to challenge myself.

I've traded in my sales hat to dive into the world of binary, and I can't wait to build products that contribute to an inclusive world! ðŸŒŽ
