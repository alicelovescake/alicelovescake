### Hi there!

I'm a learner who codes. 👩‍💻

A reader who writes. ✍🏼

An adventurer who never stops wandering. 🌍

From eating rotten shark in Iceland to floating in the Dead Sea to trekking on Everest, I love to challenge myself! 🏔️

## Now

- I'm currently a software engineer at Anthropic and maintainer at [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)!  🎉

- Previously an intern at Notion, Meta, Stripe and Rivian, on a mission to create an inclusive world with code! 🚗
