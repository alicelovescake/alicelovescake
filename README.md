### Hi there!

I'm a learner who codes. 👩‍💻

A reader who writes. ✍🏼

An adventurer who never stops wandering. 🌍

From eating rotten shark in Iceland to floating in the Dead Sea to trekking on Everest, I love to challenge myself! 🏔️

## Now

- I'm currently an intern at [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and a core contributor at [Redwood.js](https://redwoodjs.com) !  🎉

- Previously an intern at Meta and [Rivian](https://rivian.com/), on a mission to create an inclusive world with code! 🚗
