### Hi there!

I'm a learner who codes. A reader who writes. An explorer who never stops wandering. From eating rotten shark 🦈 in Iceland to floating in the Dead Sea 🌊 to trekking to the top of Everest 🏔️, I love to challenge myself 💪.

I've traded in my sales hat to dive into the world of binary, and I can't wait to build products that contribute to an inclusive world! 🌎

I'm currently building [12 products in 12 months](https://alicezhao.com/posts/12-products) to ideate, learn, and do more of what I love ... [code](https://github.com/12products)! 

Check out more on @ [alicezhao.com](alicezhao.com) 🌱
